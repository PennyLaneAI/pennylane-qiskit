"""The ibm_cloud_sdk_core project supports the following types of authentication:

  Basic Authentication
  Bearer Token
  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  Cloud Pak for Data
  No Authentication

  The authentication types that are appropriate for a particular service may vary from service to service.
  Each authentication type is implemented as an Authenticator for consumption by a service.

classes:
  Authenticator: Abstract Base Class. Implement this interface to provide custom authentication schemes to services.
  BasicAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing supplied basic authentication information to service endpoint.
  BearerTokenAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing supplied bearer token to service endpoint.
  CloudPakForDataAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing CP4D authentication information to service endpoint.
  IAMAuthenticator: Authenticator for passing IAM authentication information to service endpoint.
  NoAuthAuthenticator: Performs no authentication. Useful for testing purposes.

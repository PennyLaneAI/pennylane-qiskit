    """Dynamical decoupling insertion pass for IBM dynamic circuit backends.

    This pass works on a scheduled, physical circuit. It scans the circuit for
    idle periods of time (i.e. those containing delay instructions) and inserts
    a DD sequence of gates in those spots. These gates amount to the identity,
    so do not alter the logical action of the circuit, but have the effect of
    mitigating decoherence in those idle periods.
    As a special case, the pass allows a length-1 sequence (e.g. [XGate()]).
    In this case the DD insertion happens only when the gate inverse can be
    absorbed into a neighboring gate in the circuit (so we would still be
    replacing Delay with something that is equivalent to the identity).
    This can be used, for instance, as a Hahn echo.
    This pass ensures that the inserted sequence preserves the circuit exactly
    (including global phase).

        Args:
            durations: Durations of instructions to be used in scheduling.
            dd_sequences: Sequence of gates to apply in idle spots.
                Alternatively a list of gate sequences may be supplied that
                will preferentially be inserted if there is a delay of sufficient
                duration. This may be tuned by the optionally supplied
                ``sequence_min_length_ratios``.
            qubits: Physical qubits on which to apply DD.
                If None, all qubits will undergo DD (when possible).
            spacings: A list of lists of spacings between the DD gates.
                The available slack will be divided according to this.
                The list length must be one more than the length of dd_sequence,
                and the elements must sum to 1. If None, a balanced spacing
                will be used [d/2, d, d, ..., d, d, d/2]. This spacing only
                applies to the first subcircuit, if a ``coupling_map`` is
                specified
            skip_reset_qubits: If True, does not insert DD on idle periods that
                immediately follow initialized/reset qubits
                (as qubits in the ground state are less susceptible to decoherence).
            pulse_alignment: The hardware constraints for gate timing allocation.
                This is usually provided from ``backend.configuration().timing_constraints``.
                If provided, the delay length, i.e. ``spacing``, is implicitly adjusted to
                satisfy this constraint.
            extra_slack_distribution: The option to control the behavior of DD sequence generation.
                The duration of the DD sequence should be identical to an idle time in the
                scheduled quantum circuit, however, the delay in between gates comprising the sequence
                should be integer number in units of dt, and it might be further truncated
                when ``pulse_alignment`` is specified. This sometimes results in the duration of
                the created sequence being shorter than the idle time
                that you want to fill with the sequence, i.e. `extra slack`.
                This option takes following values.

                    * "middle": Put the extra slack to the interval at the middle of the sequence.
                    * "edges": Divide the extra slack as evenly as possible into
                      intervals at beginning and end of the sequence.
            sequence_min_length_ratios: List of minimum delay length to DD sequence ratio to satisfy
                in order to insert the DD sequence. For example if the X-X dynamical decoupling sequence
                is 320dt samples long and the available delay is 384dt it has a ratio of 384dt/320dt=1.2.
                From the perspective of dynamical decoupling this is likely to add more control noise
                than decoupling error rate reductions. The defaults value is 2.0.
            insert_multiple_cycles: If the available duration exceeds
                2*sequence_min_length_ratio*duration(dd_sequence) enable the insertion of multiple
                rounds of the dynamical decoupling sequence in that delay.
            coupling_map: directed graph representing the coupling map for the device. Specifying a
                coupling map partitions the device into subcircuits, in order to apply DD sequences
                with different pulse spacings within each. Currently support 2 subcircuits.
            alt_spacings: A list of lists of spacings between the DD gates, for the second subcircuit,
                as determined by the coupling map. If None, a balanced spacing that is staggered with
                respect to the first subcircuit will be used [d, d, d, ..., d, d, 0].
            schedule_idle_qubits: Set to true if you'd like a delay inserted on idle qubits.
                This is useful for timeline visualizations, but may cause issues
                for execution on large backends.
        Raises:
            TranspilerError: When invalid DD sequence is specified.
            TranspilerError: When pulse gate with the duration which is
                non-multiple of the alignment constraint value is found.
            TranspilerError: When the coupling map is not supported (i.e., if degree > 3)

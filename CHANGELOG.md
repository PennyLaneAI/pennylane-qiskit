# Release 0.35.0-dev

### New features since last release

### Improvements üõ†

* The UI for passing parameters to a `qfunc` generated when loading a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit`
  into PennyLane is updated to allow passing parameters as args or kwargs, rather than as
  a dictionary. The old dictionary UI continues to be supported.
  [(#406)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/406)
  [(#428)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/428)

* Measurement operations are now added to the PennyLane template when a `QuantumCircuit`
  is converted using `load`. Additionally, one can override any existing terminal
  measurements by providing a list of PennyLane
  `measurements <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/introduction/measurements.html>`_ themselves.
  [(#405)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/405)
  [(#466)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/466)

* Added the support for converting conditional operations based on mid-circuit measurements and
  two of the `ControlFlowOp` operations - `IfElseOp` and `SwitchCaseOp` when converting
  a `QuantumCircuit` using `load`.
  [(#417)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/417)
  [(#465)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/465)

* Qiskit's classical `Expr` conditionals can also be used with the supported
  `ControlFlowOp` operations.
  [(#432)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/432)

* Added conversion support for more Qiskit gates to native PennyLane operations -
  `Barrier`, `CYGate`, `CHGate`, `CPhase`, `CCZGate`, `ECRGate`, and `GlobalPhaseGate`.
  [(#449)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/449)

* Added the ability to convert a Qiskit `SparsePauliOp` instance into a PennyLane `Operator`.
  [(#401)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/401)
  [(#453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/453)

* Added a `pennylane.io` entry point for converting Qiskit operators.
  [(#453)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/453)

* Unused parameters are now ignored when a `QuantumCircuit` is converted using `load`.
  [(#454)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/454)

### Breaking changes üíî

### Deprecations üëã

### Documentation üìù

### Bug fixes üêõ

* `QiskitDevice.batch_execute()` now gracefully handles empty lists of circuits.

# Release 0.34.0

### Bug fixes üêõ

* The kwargs `job_tags` and `session_id` are passed to the correct arguments in the
  `circuit_runner` device so that they will be used in the Qiskit backend; these
  were previously ignored.
  [(#358)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/358)

* The `generate_samples` method for the `IBMQSamplerDevice` is updated to get counts
  from the nearest probability distribution rather than the quasi-distribution (which
  may contain negative probabilities and therefore raise errors).
  [(#357)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/357)

* The `generate_samples` method for the `IBMQSamplerDevice` now avoids raising an
  indexing error when some states are not populated, and labels states according to
  the Pennylane convention instead of Qiskit convention.

# Release 0.30.1

### Breaking changes

* `vqe_runner` has been updated to use IBMQ's VQE program. The first argument, `program_id`, has
  now been removed. The `upload_vqe_runner` and `delete_vqe_runner` functions have also been removed.
  [(#298)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/298)

### Improvements

* Updated many small things across the plugin to match re-works and deprecations in `qiskit`. The plugin
  can still be used in the same way as before. However, we suggest you authenticate with
  `qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMProvider` instead of `qiskit.IBMQ` from now on, as the latter is deprecated.

  [(#126)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/126)

* When parsing the IBMQ token and the IBMQ URL, the values passed as keywords take precedence over environment variables.
  [(#121)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/121)

* When loading Qiskit circuits to PennyLane templates using `load` in `converter.py`, parameters with `requires_grad=False` are bound to the circuit.  The old version bound objects that were not PennyLane `Variable`'s, but that object class is now deprecated.

  [(#100)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/100)

  One can now specify any string or number as a custom wire label,
  and use these labels to address subsystems on the device:

  ```python
  dev = qml.device('qiskit.ibmq', wires=['q1', 'ancilla', 0, 1])

  def circuit():
    qml.Hadamard(wires='q1')
    qml.CNOT(wires=[1, 'ancilla'])
  ```

### Improvements

# Release 0.9.0

### New features since last release

### Breaking changes

* Now supports Qiskit version 0.19.1. As a result of breaking changes
  within Qiskit, version 0.18 and below are no longer supported.
  [(#81)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/81)
  [(#85)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/85)
  [(#86)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/86)

  various gates for Qiskit version 0.18.0 support.
  [(#81)](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/81)

* Renamed `QiskitDevice.probabilities` to `QiskitDevice.probability` to overload
  `pennylane.Device.probability`. This fixes a bug that raises `NotImplementedError`
  when a QNode is used to compute probabilities on a IBMQ device.

# Release 0.7.0

### New features since last release

* Added the ability to automatically convert Qiskit `QuantumCircuits`
  or QASM circuits directly into PennyLane templates. The loaded
  operations can be used directly inside PennyLane circuits.
  [#55](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/55)

* Updated the list of operations such that each operation is now
  used from PennyLane. Added capability to specify the inverses
  of operations.
  [#58](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/58)

### Improvements

* Added integration tests for converting objects from Qiskit
  using PennyLane.
  [#57](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/57)

* Added warnings for hardware simulators using `analytic==True`
  when calculating expectations and variances.
  [#59](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/59)

### Bug fixes

* Removed `gates.py` including operations `Rot` and `BasisState`
  such that these operations are decomposed by PennyLane and no
  errors arise for the `BasisState` initialized with all-zero states.

# Release 0.5.0

This is a significant release, bringing the plugin up to date with the latest
PennyLane and Qiskit features.

### New features since last release

* The plugin and the tests have been completely re-written from scratch, to ensure
  high quality and remove technical debt.
  [#44](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/44)
  [#43](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/43)

* Samples and variance support have been added to all devices.
  [#46](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/46)

* Multi-qubit hermitian observables are now supported, due to
  support being added in Qiskit version 0.12.

* Support has been added for IBM Q Experience 2.0.
  [#44](https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-qiskit/pull/44)

### Improvements

* Hardware and software devices are now treated identically, with expectations,
  variance, and samples computed via the _probability_, not the amplitudes.
  This has several consequences:

  - It makes the code cleaner and simpler, as there is now one defined
    way of computing statistics.

  - It is faster in most cases, as this does not require computing
    large matrix-vector products, or Kronecker products. Instead,
    eigenvalues of single- and multi-qubit observables are computed using
    dyanamic programming.

  - It reduces the number of tests required.

* Test suite now includes tests against the IBM Q Experience, in addition
  to the local simulators.

### Bug fixes

* Due to the move to IBM Q 2.0 credentials, users remaining with IBM Q v1.0
  now must pass an additional URL argument to the service. The plugin
  has been modified to allow the user to pass this argument if required.

### New features since last release

- Added noise model and backend options to the devices as well as new observables.
- Added support for all PennyLane observables for calculating expectation values.
- Added (copied & adjusted from pennylane-forest) test for the expectation values.
- Added the necessary DefaultQubit device for comparison.
- Added logging.

### Improvements

- Changed expval_queue to obs_queue and expectations to observables as per latest pennylane.
- Reversed qregs to match the default qubit device behavior.
- Renamed devices correctly.
- Made wires explicit. If num_wires of operation is 0 then use the whole system as wires!
- Renamed the IBMQ device from `qiskit.ibm` to `qiskit.ibmq`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Unitary gate.
- Fixed the token loading and the shots.
- Fixed and updated to qiskit v0.10.1
- Fixed the valid expectation values of all devices. Along with it tests where fixed.

### Removed

- Removed the IBMQX_TOKEN import and replace with the correct args.
- Removed the unconditional make coverage.
- Removed default qubit device, this is not tested in this package!

# Release 0.0.7

### Removed

- Removed the `LegacySimulatorsQiskitDevice` as this isn't supported in `qiskit` anymore.

### Improvements

- updated to `qiskit` version `0.10.*`.

---

# Release 0.0.6

### Added

- Added the noise model to `BasicAerQiskitDevice` and `AerQiskitDevice` with unit tests (#13)
- Added unit tests for the docs (#7/#20)

### Fixed

- Fixed the ''multiple'' `backends` keyword bug (#13).
- Fixed the `par_domain` of the operations (real valued parameters) in `pos.py` (#21)
- Fixed documentation problems
- Started to 'fix' ''low'' code quality due to type hints with codacy (#15)
- Small typos and code cleanups

---

# Release 0.0.5

### New features

- `AerQiskitDevice` and `LegacySimulatorQiskitDevice` with tests

### Fixed

- Readme & documentation
- `setup.py`
- Code style clean-ups & code cleaning.
- Build setup with travis CI
- Removed unsied `num_runs` kwargs
- Fixed the overlapping kwargs with
- Better tests taken from the _ProjectQ_ plugin
- remove the sleep after computation.

# Release 2018-12-23

### New features

- The device `IbmQQiskitDevice` now can load the `ibmqx_token` from the environment variabe `IBMQX_TOKEN`

### Improvements

- Renamed `psops` to `qisktops`
- The setup/build requirements are now read from `requirements.txt`. The file is included now in the distribution file.
- Due to changes in qiskit (0.7.0) the Device `AerDevice` must be correctly termed to `BasicAerDevice`
- Due to the removal of `qiskit.unroll.CircuitBackend` the complete plugin logic needed an overhaul. Now the
  `QuantumCircuit` is used in conjunction with the new converters `dag_to_circuit` and `circuit_to_dag`
  as well as the usage of the base class `Instruction`. We hope that this change will work for most cases.

### Fixed

- The Readme: links and the usage of _device_ instead of _provider_, to stay in PennyLane-lingo
- Update to qiskit 0.7.0 made changes necessary: import location have changes

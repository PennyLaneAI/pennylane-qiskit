    """A PennyLane device for the C++ Qiskit Aer simulator.

    Please refer to the `Qiskit documentation <https://qiskit.org/documentation/>`_ for
    further information on the noise model, backend options and transpile options.

    A range of :code:`backend_options` that will be passed to the simulator and
    a range of transpile options can be given as kwargs.

    For more information on backends, please visit the
    `qiskit_aer documentation <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/index.html>`_.

    Args:
        wires (int or Iterable[Number, str]]): Number of subsystems represented by the device,
            or iterable that contains unique labels for the subsystems as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``)
            or strings (``['ancilla', 'q1', 'q2']``).
        backend (str): the desired backend
        method (str): The desired simulation method. A list of supported simulation
            methods can be returned using ``qiskit_aer.AerSimulator().available_methods()``, or by referring
            to the ``AerSimulator`` `documentation <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.AerSimulator.html>`__.
        shots (int or None): number of circuit evaluations/random samples used
            to estimate expectation values and variances of observables. For statevector backends,
            setting to ``None`` results in computing statistics like expectation values and variances analytically.

    Keyword Args:
        name (str): The name of the circuit. Default ``'circuit'``.
        compile_backend (BaseBackend): The backend used for compilation. If you wish
            to simulate a device compliant circuit, you can specify a backend here.
        noise_model (NoiseModel): NoiseModel Object from ``qiskit_aer.noise``

The PennyLane-Qiskit plugin integrates the Qiskit quantum computing framework with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/documentation/>`_ is an open-source framework for quantum computing.


Features
========

* Provides three devices to be used with PennyLane: ``qiskit.aer``, ``qiskit.basicaer`` and ``qiskit.ibmq``.
  These devices provide access to the various backends, including the IBM hardware accessible through the cloud.

* Supports a wide range of PennyLane operations and expectation values across the providers.

* Combine Qiskit's high performance simulator and hardware backend support with PennyLane's automatic
  differentiation and optimization.

Installation
============

This plugin requires Python version 3.5 and above, as well as PennyLane and Qiskit.
Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pennylane-qiskit

To test that the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

in the source folder. Tests restricted to a specific provider can be run by executing
``make test-basicaer``, ``make test-aer``, and ``make test-ibmq``.

.. note::

    Tests on the `IBMQ device <https://pennylane-qiskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/ibmq.html>`_ can
    only be run if a ``ibmqx_token`` for the
    `IBM Q experience <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/>`_ is
    configured in the `PennyLane configuration file
    <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/configuration.html>`_.

    If this is the case, running ``make test`` also executes tests on the ``ibmq`` device.
    By default tests on the ``ibmq`` device run with ``ibmq_qasm_simulator`` backend
    and those done by the ``basicaer`` and ``aer`` device are run with the ``qasm_simulator``
    backend. At the time of writing this means that the test are "free".
    Please verify that this is also the case for your account.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/documentation/>`_ is an open-source compilation framework capable of targeting various
types of hardware and a high-performance quantum computer simulator with emulation capabilities, and various
compiler plug-ins.

This PennyLane plugin allows to use both the software and hardware backends of Qiskit as devices for PennyLane.


Features
========

* Provides three devices to be used with PennyLane: ``qiskit.basicaer``, ``qiskit.aer`` and ``qiskit.ibmq``.
  These devices provide access to the various backends.

* Supports a wide range of PennyLane operations and expectation values across the providers.

* Combine Qiskit's high performance simulator and hardware backend support with PennyLane's automatic
  differentiation and optimization.

Installation
============

This plugin requires Python version 3.5 and above, as well as PennyLane and Qiskit.
Installation of this plugin, as well as all dependencies, can be done using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pennylane-qiskit

To test that the PennyLane Qiskit plugin is working correctly you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make test

in the source folder. Tests restricted to a specific provider can be run by executing
``make test-basicaer``, ``make test-aer`` ``make test-ibmq``.

.. note::

    Tests on the `IBMQ device <https://pennylane-qiskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/ibmq.html>`_ can
    only be run if a ``ibmqx_token`` for the
    `IBM Q experience <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/>`_ is
    configured in the `PennyLane configuration file
    <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/configuration.html>`_.

    If this is the case, running ``make test`` also executes tests on the ``ibmq`` device.
    By default tests on the ``ibmq`` device run with ``ibmq_qasm_simulator`` backend
    and those done by the ``basicaer`` and ``aer`` device are run with the ``qasm_simulator``
    backend. At the time of writing this means that the test are "free".
    Please verify that this is also the case for your account.

Getting started
===============

Once the PennyLane-Qiskit plugin is installed, the three provided Qiskit devices
can be accessed straightaway in PennyLane.

You can instantiate a ``'qiskit.aer'`` device for PennyLane with:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev = qml.device('qiskit.aer', wires=2)

This device can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane.
A simple quantum function that returns the expectation value of a measurement and depends on three classical input
parameters would look like:

.. code-block:: python

    @qml.qnode(dev)
    def circuit(x, y, z):
        qml.RZ(z, wires=[0])
        qml.RY(y, wires=[0])
        qml.RX(x, wires=[0])
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(wires=1))

You can then execute the circuit like any other function to get the quantum mechanical expectation value.

.. code-block:: python

    circuit(0.2, 0.1, 0.3)

You can also change the default device's backend with

.. code-block:: python

    dev = qml.device('qiskit.aer', wires=2, backend='unitary_simulator')

To get a current overview what backends are available you can query this by

.. code-block:: python

    dev.capabilities()['backend']

While the device ``'qiskit.aer'`` is the standard go-to simulator that is provided along
the Qiskit main package installation, there exists a natively included python simulator
that is slower but will work usually without the need to check out other dependencies
(gcc, blas and so on) which can be used by ``'qiskit.basicaer'``.

Another important difference between the two is that while ``'qiskit.aer'``
supports a simulation with noise, ``'qiskit.basicaer'`` does not.

Noise models
============

You can instantiate a noise model and apply it to the device by calling

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    import qiskit
    from qiskit.providers.aer.noise.device import basic_device_noise_model

    qiskit.IBMQ.load_account()
    provider = qiskit.IBMQ.get_provider(group='open')
    ibmq_16_melbourne = provider.get_backend('ibmq_16_melbourne')
    device_properties = ibmq_16_melbourne.properties()

    noise_model = basic_device_noise_model(device_properties)

    dev = qml.device('qiskit.aer', wires=2, noise_model=noise_model)

Please refer to the Qiskit documentation for more information on
`noise models <https://qiskit.org/aer>`_.

IBM Q Experience
================

PennyLane-Qiskit supports running PennyLane on IBM Q hardware via the ``qistkit.ibmq`` device.
You can choose between different backends - either simulators or real hardware.

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev = qml.device('qiskit.ibmq', wires=2, backend='ibmq_16_melbourne')

By default, the ``qiskit.ibmq`` device will attempt to use an already active or stored
IBM Q account. If none are available, you may also directly pass your IBM Q API token,
as well as an optional URL:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev = qml.device('qiskit.ibmq', wires=2, backend='ibmq_qasm_simulator', ibmqx_token="XXX")


In order to avoid accidentally publishing your token, it is best to store it using the
``qiskit.IBMQ.save_account()`` function. Alternatively, you can specify the token or URL via the
`PennyLane configuration file <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/configuration.html>`__ by
adding a section such as

.. code::

  [qiskit.global]

    [qiskit.ibmq]
    ibmqx_token = "XXX"
    ibmqx_url = "XXX"

Note that, by default, the ``qiskit.ibmq`` device uses the simulator backend
``ibmq_qasm_simulator``, but this may be changed to any of the real backends as given by

.. code-block:: python

    dev.capabilities()['backend']

.. gettingstarted-end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

Please refer to the `plugin documentation <https://pennylane-qiskit.readthedocs.io/>`_ as
well as to the `PennyLane documentation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/>`_ for further reference.

The PennyLane-Qiskit plugin integrates the Qiskit quantum computing framework with PennyLane's
quantum machine learning capabilities.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/documentation/>`_ is an open-source framework for quantum computing.

Features
========

* Provides three devices to be used with PennyLane: ``qiskit.aer``, ``qiskit.basicaer`` and ``qiskit.ibmq``.
  These devices provide access to the various backends, including the IBM hardware accessible through the cloud.

* Supports a wide range of PennyLane operations and expectation values across the providers.

* Combine Qiskit's high performance simulator and hardware backend support with PennyLane's automatic
  differentiation and optimization.
